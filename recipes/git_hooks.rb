Chef::Log.warn(<<~GIT_HOOKS_WARNING)
  The sprout-git::git_hooks recipe is now DEPRECATED!

  Git 2.9 added new configuration options that made the configuration of hooks far
  simpler. This is now the recommended way to add git hooks. At the same time we
  have made our own credential scanner which we are going to distribute separately
  from sprout-git.

  The new configuration options are used in the new sprout-git::git_hooks_core
  recipe. It provides a more opinionated but far less complex method of installing
  system-wide git hooks.

  You can remove the existing git hooks by deleting the following directories.
  Make sure that you have backed up any custom hooks that you would like to keep!

  * /usr/local/share/githooks
  * $HOME/.githooks
  * [YOUR_PROJECTS...]/githooks

  Or, if you trust us, (please review the script for safety anyway) you can run
  the script linked below which will remove the default hooks that were added and
  warn about any custom hooks that should be backed up and migrated.

  We're sorry for any inconvenience but we hope you'll like the far simpler new
  approach.
